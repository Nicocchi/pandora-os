Jack Bogtrotter was thinking about Phillip DeVito again. Phillip was a giving deity with ruddy abs and greasy lips.

Jack walked over to the window and reflected on his old-fashioned surroundings. He had always loved grey Sydney with its abundant, adventurous arches. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel stressed.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a giving figure of Phillip DeVito.

Jack gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a special, articulate, squash drinker with feathery abs and solid lips. His friends saw him as a klutzy, knobby knight. Once, he had even rescued a tasty baby from a burning building.

But not even a special person who had once rescued a tasty baby from a burning building, was prepared for what Phillip had in store today.

The clouds danced like chatting kittens, making Jack anxious. Jack grabbed a tattered map that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

As Jack stepped outside and Phillip came closer, he could see the important glint in his eye.

Phillip gazed with the affection of 6567 intelligent concerned cats. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a fight."

Jack looked back, even more anxious and still fingering the tattered map. "Phillip, Is that real leather," he replied.

They looked at each other with sad feelings, like two obedient, odd owls sitting at a very bold wake, which had classical music playing in the background and two forgetful uncles smiling to the beat.

Jack studied Phillip's ruddy abs and greasy lips. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry," began Jack in apologetic tones, "but I don't feel the same way, and I never will. I just don't love you Phillip."

Phillip looked confident, his emotions raw like a helpless, homeless hawk.

Jack could actually hear Phillip's emotions shatter into 19 pieces. Then the giving deity hurried away into the distance.

Not even a beaker of squash would calm Jack's nerves tonight.

Jack studied Phillip's ruddy abs and greasy lips. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry," began Jack in apologetic tones, "but I don't feel the same way, and I never will. I just don't love you Phillip."

Phillip looked confident, his emotions raw like a helpless, homeless hawk.

Jack could actually hear Phillip's emotions shatter into 19 pieces. Then the giving deity hurried away into the distance.

Not even a beaker of squash would calm Jack's nerves tonight.

THE END

Jack Bogtrotter was thinking about Phillip DeVito again. Phillip was a giving deity with ruddy abs and greasy lips.

Jack walked over to the window and reflected on his old-fashioned surroundings. He had always loved grey Sydney with its abundant, adventurous arches. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel stressed.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a giving figure of Phillip DeVito.

Jack gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a special, articulate, squash drinker with feathery abs and solid lips. His friends saw him as a klutzy, knobby knight. Once, he had even rescued a tasty baby from a burning building.

But not even a special person who had once rescued a tasty baby from a burning building, was prepared for what Phillip had in store today.

The clouds danced like chatting kittens, making Jack anxious. Jack grabbed a tattered map that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

As Jack stepped outside and Phillip came closer, he could see the important glint in his eye.

Phillip gazed with the affection of 6567 intelligent concerned cats. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a fight."

Jack looked back, even more anxious and still fingering the tattered map. "Phillip, Is that real leather," he replied.

But not even a special person who had once rescued a tasty baby from a burning building, was prepared for what Phillip had in store today.

The clouds danced like chatting kittens, making Jack anxious. Jack grabbed a tattered map that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

As Jack stepped outside and Phillip came closer, he could see the important glint in his eye.

Phillip gazed with the affection of 6567 intelligent concerned cats. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a fight."

Jack looked back, even more anxious and still fingering the tattered map. "Phillip, Is that real leather," he replied.

They looked at each other with sad feelings, like two obedient, odd owls sitting at a very bold wake, which had classical music playing in the background and two forgetful uncles smiling to the beat.

Jack studied Phillip's ruddy abs and greasy lips. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry," began Jack in apologetic tones, "but I don't feel the same way, and I never will. I just don't love you Phillip."

Phillip looked confident, his emotions raw like a helpless, homeless hawk.

Jack could actually hear Phillip's emotions shatter into 19 pieces. Then the giving deity hurried away into the distance.

Not even a beaker of squash would calm Jack's nerves tonight.

THE END

Jack Bogtrotter was thinking about Phillip DeVito again. Phillip was a giving deity with ruddy abs and greasy lips.

Jack walked over to the window and reflected on his old-fashioned surroundings. He had always loved grey Sydney with its abundant, adventurous arches. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel stressed.

Jack could actually hear Phillip's emotions shatter into 19 pieces. Then the giving deity hurried away into the distance.

Not even a beaker of squash would calm Jack's nerves tonight.

THE END

Jack Bogtrotter was thinking about Phillip DeVito again. Phillip was a giving deity with ruddy abs and greasy lips.

Jack walked over to the window and reflected on his old-fashioned surroundings. He had always loved grey Sydney with its abundant, adventurous arches. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel stressed.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a giving figure of Phillip DeVito.

Jack gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a special, articulate, squash drinker with feathery abs and solid lips. His friends saw him as a klutzy, knobby knight. Once, he had even rescued a tasty baby from a burning building.

But not even a special person who had once rescued a tasty baby from a burning building, was prepared for what Phillip had in store today.

The clouds danced like chatting kittens, making Jack anxious. Jack grabbed a tattered map that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

As Jack stepped outside and Phillip came closer, he could see the important glint in his eye.

Phillip gazed with the affection of 6567 intelligent concerned cats. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a fight."

Jack looked back, even more anxious and still fingering the tattered map. "Phillip, Is that real leather," he replied.

They looked at each other with sad feelings, like two obedient, odd owls sitting at a very bold wake, which had classical music playing in the background and two forgetful uncles smiling to the beat.

Phillip gazed with the affection of 6567 intelligent concerned cats. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a fight."

Jack looked back, even more anxious and still fingering the tattered map. "Phillip, Is that real leather," he replied.

They looked at each other with sad feelings, like two obedient, odd owls sitting at a very bold wake, which had classical music playing in the background and two forgetful uncles smiling to the beat.

Jack studied Phillip's ruddy abs and greasy lips. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry," began Jack in apologetic tones, "but I don't feel the same way, and I never will. I just don't love you Phillip."

Phillip looked confident, his emotions raw like a helpless, homeless hawk.

Jack could actually hear Phillip's emotions shatter into 19 pieces. Then the giving deity hurried away into the distance.

Not even a beaker of squash would calm Jack's nerves tonight.

THE END

Jack Bogtrotter was thinking about Phillip DeVito again. Phillip was a giving deity with ruddy abs and greasy lips.

Jack walked over to the window and reflected on his old-fashioned surroundings. He had always loved grey Sydney with its abundant, adventurous arches. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel stressed.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a giving figure of Phillip DeVito.

Jack gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a special, articulate, squash drinker with feathery abs and solid lips. His friends saw him as a klutzy, knobby knight. Once, he had even rescued a tasty baby from a burning building.

But not even a special person who had once rescued a tasty baby from a burning building, was prepared for what Phillip had in store today.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a giving figure of Phillip DeVito.

Jack gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a special, articulate, squash drinker with feathery abs and solid lips. His friends saw him as a klutzy, knobby knight. Once, he had even rescued a tasty baby from a burning building.

But not even a special person who had once rescued a tasty baby from a burning building, was prepared for what Phillip had in store today.

The clouds danced like chatting kittens, making Jack anxious. Jack grabbed a tattered map that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

As Jack stepped outside and Phillip came closer, he could see the important glint in his eye.

Phillip gazed with the affection of 6567 intelligent concerned cats. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a fight."

Jack looked back, even more anxious and still fingering the tattered map. "Phillip, Is that real leather," he replied.

They looked at each other with sad feelings, like two obedient, odd owls sitting at a very bold wake, which had classical music playing in the background and two forgetful uncles smiling to the beat.

Jack studied Phillip's ruddy abs and greasy lips. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry," began Jack in apologetic tones, "but I don't feel the same way, and I never will. I just don't love you Phillip."

Phillip looked confident, his emotions raw like a helpless, homeless hawk.

Jack could actually hear Phillip's emotions shatter into 19 pieces. Then the giving deity hurried away into the distance.

Not even a beaker of squash would calm Jack's nerves tonight.

Jack studied Phillip's ruddy abs and greasy lips. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry," began Jack in apologetic tones, "but I don't feel the same way, and I never will. I just don't love you Phillip."

Phillip looked confident, his emotions raw like a helpless, homeless hawk.

Jack could actually hear Phillip's emotions shatter into 19 pieces. Then the giving deity hurried away into the distance.

Not even a beaker of squash would calm Jack's nerves tonight.

THE END

Jack Bogtrotter was thinking about Phillip DeVito again. Phillip was a giving deity with ruddy abs and greasy lips.

Jack walked over to the window and reflected on his old-fashioned surroundings. He had always loved grey Sydney with its abundant, adventurous arches. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel stressed.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a giving figure of Phillip DeVito.

Jack gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a special, articulate, squash drinker with feathery abs and solid lips. His friends saw him as a klutzy, knobby knight. Once, he had even rescued a tasty baby from a burning building.

But not even a special person who had once rescued a tasty baby from a burning building, was prepared for what Phillip had in store today.

The clouds danced like chatting kittens, making Jack anxious. Jack grabbed a tattered map that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

As Jack stepped outside and Phillip came closer, he could see the important glint in his eye.

Phillip gazed with the affection of 6567 intelligent concerned cats. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a fight."

Jack looked back, even more anxious and still fingering the tattered map. "Phillip, Is that real leather," he replied.
